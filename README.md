## Problem

We have a number of users that we need to keep track of, we also wish to keep track
of the connections between users.

## Solution

We would like you to build a web app that allows to:
- Add a user.
- Add a connection between 2 users.
- Retrieve all the users that are directly connected with a given user.
- Show a stats report regarding the relations between the users.

A user is defined by 2 pieces of information, an id and a name.

## Restrictions

- You may use any technology, libraries, frameworks and database of your choice.
- Consider that your solution should come with deployment instructions and tests.

## Delivery

Please provide your solution in a compressed file.
Create a project available through a public repository (e.g. git) that we can access (we
would like to be able to see how your solution progresses).
